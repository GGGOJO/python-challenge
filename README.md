# python-challenge: Python programming fun!
For this data analysis, I tried to applied only python language to two different datasets:
* Financial data
* Election Polling data
Both of these python challenges involve real-world situations. 

This repository has two folders (PyBankFolder and PyPollFolder) with:
* python code py.file
* Resources folder with the raw data in .xlxs
* Analysis folder with the final/print output in .txt

# PyBank
Goal: With the budget_data.csv, I identified:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of these changes
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyPoll
Goal: With the election_data.csv, I found out:
  * The total number of votes casted
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes for each candidate
  * The total number of votes for each candidate
  * The winning candidate

# Tips/Reflections
Using what I have learned so far and only using Python to conduct the analysis, I have come to a deeper appreciation for Pandas and NumPy libraries/modules, which makes data analysis faster. However, it is great to know that you can still run analysis through Python reader. It is also good practice to conduct loops (for and while) and store variables, lists, and dictionaries. Of course, there was a lot of debugging of mistyping and not knowing if I should use a parantheses, square, or curly bracket. Patience, young Skywalker, Patience. Or maybe that should be Practice, young Skywalker, Practice. :)
